# How will RISE help?

In the US, social justice is imbalanced. We live in an economy that increasingly operates to serve the interests and desires of the wealthy. Politics today awards the wealthy with an unhealthy measure of influence; we can **counterbalance** this influence with a lobby group of our own. 

The team behind RISE is dissatisfied with existing approaches and we aim to make changes in public policy that also take the rights and needs of the middle- and lower-classes into account.
**RISE will level the economic playing field. RISE will give political power to the middle- and lower-classes and provide real solutions to the problems they are grappling with daily. **

**We have ambitious goals and ask that you help us reach those goals.** Join us, your fellow middle- and lower-class friends and neighbors, to band together so that we can lobby for our own rights. Help us influence public officials for our own interests. Once we get our influence into Washington, we will see our lives and standards of living improve.
