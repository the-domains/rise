# Why is this Happening? 

In a nutshell, this is happening because those that know how to work the legal system are smart, and wealthier than the rest of us. Consequently, they end up with significant political clout. They further their own interests and work the system to their advantage. These folks are not necessarily out to harm the middle- and lower- classes. Instead, because the middle- and lower-classes are not actively looking out after their own interests by working the system themselves, they are falling behind. 

**Two ways of working the system include lobbying and rent-seeking. **

[Lobbying is the act of soliciting or ][0]trying to influence the actions of public officials, the votes of members of a legislative body, or the passage of a bill. 

[Lobbying is conducted by many][1] types of people, associations and organized groups, including individuals in the private sector, corporations, fellow legislators or government officials, or advocacy groups. 

**Those who lobby pour millions of dollars into the act of lobbying. 
**

[Rent-seeking][2] is when a company, organization or individual uses their resources to obtain an economic gain from others without reciprocating any benefits back to society or without adding any additional value to the economy. Rent-seeking activities don't create any benefit for society; rather, they redistribute resources from taxpayers to special-interest groups. Rent-seeking include executives who pad profits and reap big bonuses by lobbying for government favors and financial professionals who leverage tax loopholes.
